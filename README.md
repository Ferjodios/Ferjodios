| Repository | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| [**Titanomachy**](https://github.com/Ferjodios/cripto-p1) | ⚔️ Titanomachy is an asynchronous turn-based RPG where players register, choose their characters, and battle. The twist? All attack names are encrypted to maintain secrecy and fairness. Players can attack, defend, or heal during their turn. The game ends when a player runs out of health, and the winner is notified. The game is built using Tkinter for an easy graphical interface, and it ensures secure authentication and encrypted communication with players. |
| [**John The Ripper Craking Passwords Analisys**](https://github.com/DavidY343/ciber_p1_jtr) | 🔐 In this project, we focus on password cracking using John the Ripper. The repository showcases our analysis of results, exploring different attack modes and strategies to efficiently crack hashed passwords. The goal is to demonstrate how John the Ripper can be used for security testing and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of password encryption. |
| [**A Star Algorithm**](https://github.com/DavidY343/CSP-and-A-start-algorithm) | 🚑 In this project, I implemented the A* heuristic algorithm and explored different heuristic models, including brute force, Manhattan distance, and Euclidean distance, to optimize pathfinding. The goal was to compare the performance and accuracy of various heuristics in solving search problems. |
| [**Distributed Communication with RPC and Web Services**](https://github.com/DavidY343/SSDD_final) | 🖧 In this project, we implement a distributed system with multiple communication protocols, including RPC, Socket, and Web Services. The system allows for efficient client-server communication using Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) for structured operations, and sockets for handling real-time requests such as file retrieval and user management. Additionally, we deploy a simple web service using SOAP to provide the current time via a web interface. |
| [**Mongo DB Migration Process**](https://github.com/DavidY343/arquidatos) | 🛠️ In this project, we focus on performing ETL processes on a dirty database, transforming it into a clean version. The cleaned data is then uploaded to MongoDB, where we implement preprocessing, validation schemas, and aggregations to ensure efficient and structured data management. |
